# Iris-Flower-Classification
In this project, you will build a simple Machine Learning model to classify iris flowers into one of three species: • Setosa • Versicolor • Virginica Classification is based on sepal and petal measurements. This classic dataset is ideal for learning basic supervised learning techniques.
# Iris Flower Classification - Week 1 Project

This project is part of the NSP Nexus AI/ML Internship.

## Objective

- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Steps
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Visualize relationships
3. Split the data
4. Train the model
5. Evaluate performance
